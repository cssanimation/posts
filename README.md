# CSSAnimation.rocks posts

The files here are used on the CSS Animation Rocks website. If you are interested in translating any of the articles, please grab one of these files and use it as the source. It means I'll be able to more easily slot the result into the website.

## Beginning a translation

Firstly, thank you for choosing to translate one of my articles! I really appreciate. Here's how you can contribute. 

Choose an article from those listed. For example, [this one on the 12 principles](https://github.com/cssanimation/posts/blob/master/2015-03-21-principles.md). You can then select the *Raw* link on the top-right of the content to see it. It should [look like this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cssanimation/posts/master/2015-03-21-principles.md).

This raw content is the source code for the article. Within it, you can edit some of the "front matter" (the content in the section at the top). This includes the *title*, *description*, and *tweet text*.

The next step is to translate the content itself. It's written using [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

## Delivering the finished article

Once the content has been translated, you can either send the markdown file as an attachment to [hello@cssanimation.rocks](mailto:hello@cssanimation.rocks) or put it in a [Gist](https://gist.github.com) and send me the link to the Gist.
